Holy heck June was another fast-paced, action-packed month. 


## Overview
In British Columbia, we are now in [phase 3 of BC's restart plan](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/safety/emergency-preparedness-response-recovery/covid-19-provincial-support/phase-3). The cases are stabilizing day by day here and life is starting to feel a bit more normal. We have seen some friends and seen more outdoors since entering phase 2. 

Regarding work, I've been logging that progress in a separate post. There have been ups and downs this month - some days I love what I do and cannot stop coding whereas other days I feel lost. Regardless, I am learning lots and am learning fast. I am forever grateful of this opportunity and feel extremely lucky to be able to participate in hackathons as my job (huge thank you to MLH for providing me and 144 others with this extremely useful, educational, and fun opportunity).
