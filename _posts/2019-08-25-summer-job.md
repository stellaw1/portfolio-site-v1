"When I say Geering, you say Up. Geering! Up!"

This past summer has been a blast. Though, it has been busy and hectic, it was an experience that was much more than I could have asked for. 


## Workshops gang
In late April, we began a week of training for the workshops season (May/ June). Workshops season meant that we went around to different schools in Vancouver, or sometimes farther, and lead a 1-2 hour workshop on different science topics. These workshops were usually taught by a pair of instructors and involved lots of hands on activities for the students. 

During workshops, the most tiring part was the commute... Driving to Vancouver during traffic hour every morning was not the most enjoyable. However, it was completely worth it whenever a teacher or student loves the workshop and that because of it they now want to pursue a career in STEM. 

Almost every instructor also went on one week of outreach, meaning they spend one week in a farther city, teaching workshops to students that may not have an abundance of resources available to them. I spend my outreach week in Chilliwack and taught at schools in Harrison Hot Springs and Aboriginal communities, etc. On these outreach workshops, I could especially feel the impact one hour of our time made in the kids' lives. I got to introduce fundamental science subjects to elementary school youth in a fun and exciting way that it sparked a new passion for them. 


## SSgang
During the later half of the summer (July/ August), we moved into summer camp season. This part was definitely more tiring than workshops, as it entailed more responsibility and time, but it was also more rewarding. Because we spent an entire week with the same group of kiddos, we were given an oppotunity to develop a relationship with them. By talking to them, playing with them, and joking around with them, on top of teaching them, I got the chance to learn more about their lives and what they want to do in the future. They often were interested in what I do and what I learn in school, which sometimes turned into something they wanted to pursue!

Not only was this entire experience impactful to the youth, I enjoyed myself immensely throughout the entirety of the job. The staff is an incredible bunch. Every colleague was social, kind, and helpful in every situation and we all got along great. Especially, our group of 10 South Surrey staff, who I saw every single day for two months straight, had the best dynamic. By the end of the summer, we were all crying that we would not get to spend all of our time together anymore. 


## Summary 
In short, if you love kids and science, I highly recommend you to apply to work at Geering Up. Not only will you come out of the experience with a sense of satisfation in that you have impacted lives of youth to pursue STEM careers, you will also gain lifelong friends.
