The shortest month of the year was somehow the most event-filled experience. 


## Highlights
The greatest highlight of the month is my trip to Toronto, Ontario. 

The story begins with a deal with my brother - if I secured a summer co-op position before my reading break, I would go visit my brother... Turns out I ended up getting offers from two different companies (this was a whole other story/ struggle). Anyhow, this trip was one of the best decisions I have ever made because it was an eye opening experience that sparked new dreams for me, specifically in terms of career goals. 

Seeing how big and opportunity-filled the big city was made me realize how sheltered and closed-minded I was, living in Vancouver. Don't get me wrong, I love Vancouver and there are so many traits that Vancouver wins at, but it is true that Toronto and the people in Toronto have a hustle about them that makes the city more fast-paced than Vancouver. I believe that an internship experience in Toronto could not only help me learn at a fast pace but also teach me an entirely different set of skills. In September, I hope to secure a co-op opportunity at a company in Toronto that can help me reach a new level. 

Until then, here are some memories from Toronto that I will treasure forever :')

## Lowlights
I thought I would be ecstatic to receive any job offer, given that it is my first co-op term, however, the story about my two job offers oddly was the low of my month. 

Long story short, I had to make a decision about my a job offer (at a smaller company) in a short amount of time. I had had three interviews by that point and had three more scheduled - one of them at a bigger company that I've always dreamed of working for. However, due to the system my co-op program enforces, I had 2 days to respond, and if I chose to accept, all my upcoming interviews would be cancelled. This was not enough time for an overthinker/ perfectionist like myself. 

My dilemma was between choosing the safer route (secure a job first and be grateful that it happened so early on, given it is my first co-op term) or the riskier route (to believe in myself and continue seeking a more suitable co-op position). In the end, I was able to negotiate with my co-op coordinator: the deadline to respond to the first offer was extended by five hours, giving me enough time to interview at SAP. 

In the end, I could not fully justify either choice; it was one of those situations that you have no idea how it will play out. You just have to pick one and be okay with it. After my SAP interview, I thought I had butchered it, so, feeling unconfident, I ended up accepting the position at the smaller company. And, for the following two weeks, I was happy with my decision. 

Then, on the first day of reading break, I received an email - "Job offer at SAP", and I just broke down. Never have I ever thought I would be so devastated to receive a job offer. I was initially wrapped up around the thought that I had made the wrong choice and that a major opportunity was missed. "Why didn't I just reject the first offer," I would think to myself. 

Now, I am able to think of the experience as a lesson. It taught me that nothing is perfect and not everything always plays out the way you want it to. Unfortunate timing and a lack of confidence lead to a missed opportunity this time, but I came out of it with a stronger sense of self and more concrete goals. I am confident that my next seeking term will be even more fulfilling. Plus, if I hadn't accepted the first offer, I wouldn't have visited Toronto this month, and that experience in and of itself was worth it.
