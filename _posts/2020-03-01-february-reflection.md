The shortest month of the year was somehow the most event-filled experience. 


## Highlights
The greatest highlight of the month is my trip to Toronto, Ontario. 

The story begins with a deal with my brother - if I secured a summer co-op position before my reading break, I would go visit my brother... Turns out I ended up getting offers from two different companies (this was a whole other story/ struggle). Anyhow, this trip was one of the best decisions I have ever made because it was an eye opening experience that sparked new dreams for me, specifically in terms of career goals. 

Seeing how big and opportunity-filled the big city was made me realize how sheltered and closed-minded I was, living in Vancouver. Don't get me wrong, I love Vancouver and there are so many traits that Vancouver wins at, but it is true that Toronto and the people in Toronto have a hustle about them that makes the city more fast-paced than Vancouver. I believe that an internship experience in Toronto could not only help me learn at a fast pace but also teach me an entirely different set of skills. In September, I hope to secure a co-op opportunity at a company in Toronto that can help me reach a new level. 


## Lowlights
I thought I would be ecstatic to receive any job offer, given that it is my first co-op term, however, the story about my two job offers oddly was the low of my month. 

Due to timing and a lack of wisdom,
