Man my life is so perfect. The best thing about being in your twenties is that you can be unafraid of anything. It's the time of your life where you get to do anything and everything you want. No commitments and no pressure - well, there is quite a bit of pressure, but not from anyone but yourself. You can be friends with whomever you want and avoid the people you dislike. And that goes for every aspect in life. If you choose to be career oriented, you can spend all your time working towards career goals without needing to sacrifice time for anything or anyone else. If you choose to focus on your future family/ relationship, you get to date as much as you want and meet as many new people as you are welcome to meeting. The limits are endless. Most people opt for a balance of every aspect, and here's the best part, you get to choose the balance of what fraction of time/ effort you dedicate to each aspect. 

I've realized recently that a good amount of my time is put towards my career goals. In other words, I am a workaholic. I find that I can't fully relax and be myself when I have pending work to be finished, and my schedule is usually packed to my limit. I don't like having too much free time on a routinely basis, rather I enjoy having a busy few months and then a period of vacation time off after. For example, for this winter semeter of school, I chose to do a full course load and take on a project alongside that that takes full time hours of work. However, I balance this out by having a full month of in May where I get to travel and relax to prepare for a full time internship starting in June. This doens't really matter since it is really just a personal preference thing. The biggest realization I had is that I genuinely enjoy putting in hard work. Whether that comes in the form of time or difficulty doesn't matter. I enjoy social hangouts more after I put in some productive hours and am more confident in my achievements knowing I put in the time and effort to get there. I am still on the journey of developing, growing, and finding myself. And i think I realized that working myself to my limits and spending every free hour being productive is part of who I am. What the motivation is behind this is beyond me (I wish I took psychology, there is probably some plausible explanation behind this constant need to be the best). 

This is a gentle reminder to self to spend an equal amount of time doing things I love and to not overwork myself. I've grown a lot in the past two years and did a lot of reflecting during covid/ quarantine. I have a good sense of my limits and how to keep my mental at a good place. It's weird though, this has almost allowed me to push myself more. It's like the same idea of having a safety net or wearing a helmet when skiing. I am able to push myself past my limits a bit, knowing there is something to catch me when I burnout. I did realize today though that I should be spending a bit more time doing things that I love. I do not want to lose myself or let my twenties pass without experiencing everything that I hope to. 

This is a reminder of some of the things I love:
- my friends <3 they are such genuine and kind people that make me smile whenever they are around. They bring me so so much joy and I'm so happy I get to experience new things with them growing through our twenties together. I appreciate them for making me laugh when I'm down and supporting me in my work. 
- music! I've been enjoying making playlists with/ for friends and giving/ receiving music recommendations. It is my biggest belief that music is the best way to bond with new and old friends. It's also a great way to express and soak in your feelings when it is hard to put it into words. 
- sports! Especially team sports and winter sports. They are such a fun way to get some physical activity in while also being a social experience. I hate that I was too self conscious in high school to participate in more team sports, but I also blame it on my anemia a bit since that affects my physical abilities. 
- meeting new people, observing old friends, and getting to know new friends better
- good food

In short, there is much to be grateful for. There is much to experience still and I am happy with where my life is. 


PS. I think I want to really focus on web 3.0 development as a career goal. I love how new it is and the work style matches mine. 



Excited about life, <br>
