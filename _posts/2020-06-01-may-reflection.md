May was full of ups and downs, but it was a good start to my roaring 20's nonetheless!


## Updates
The future is definitely looking brighter, here in British Columbia, Canada. The curve has flattened and we are in phase 1 of a province wide plan to return to normal from being in quarantine / social isolation. 

I am very grateful and lucky to have spent the last month in isolation alongside my boyfriend and his family, as I am a very anxious person by nature and would've went insane if I had to live alone for two entire months. 

### Productice things I've accomplished
- secured an internship for summer 2020!
- kept on top of summer courses
- daily workout challenges with my best buddies, Jun and Rav

### Unproductive things I've accomplished
- video games - Stardew Valley and Valorant
- lots of Amazon orders
- baked lots of cookies


## Now what?
There wasn't a heck lot that happened in May to reflect on, which is fair considering there wasn't a heck lot that we could do during quarantine. The one thing that stood out to me is how covid has brought out trust issues for me. After having my internship, my best friend's flight, and a subletting contract cancelled, every opportunity that I seeked after that was with an unhopeful atitude and low expectations. Even after securing some form of collateral, there would be this floating anxiety at the back of my mind that it might still be taken away at the last second. I'm not sure if I'm the only person that developed this unhealthy mindset, or if many others experience the same? My guess is the latter. 

Also, this is kind of irrelevant, but I feel like I am slowly losing sight of my new years resolution that I set for this year. My anxiety was pretty bad at the beginning of May, but I think it's getting a bit better now, as quarantine phases out. I think it is worth to read back on my January reflection blog post to remind myself of goals and such to focus on. I remember feeling a lot of self growth at the beginning of the year compared to now, so I'm going to read back and either revive those goals or set new ones to continue my journey of self growth and anxiety control.  

Looking forward to a productive summer, <br>
Stella
