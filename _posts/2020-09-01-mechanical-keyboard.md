As I say... Everyone needs an expensive hobby :)


# Summary
Sooo I have been talking about building a custom keyboard from scratch for the longest time, and finally put the order in during quarantine. I chose a Ten Key Less (TKL) layout, hot swappable PCB, and Gateron Brown switches. I will link the exact parts/ stores I ordered from below. The total for my keyboard was around $170, but it did take almost two months for all the parts to ship. Overall, I am very happy with the final build :)


# Build Process
### Step 1 - Order
Do you research on what size/ layout/ switches/ etc that you want for your keyboard and place orders for those parts. Essentially, there are six components you need: Case, PCB, Switches, Mounting Plate, Stabilizers, and Keycaps. [This](https://www.techspot.com/guides/1625-diy-build-your-own-mechanical-keyboard/) is a really good tutorial to follow along. 

### Step 2 - Check
When the parts arrive, you first have to check that there are no defects. Specifically, there are softwares that either come with the PCB or can be found online, used to check that the PCB is printed properly. If everything looks good, you can move on to building the keyboard. 

### Step 3 - Build
1) Separate case into top case and bottom case
2) Assemble stabilizers (tutorial [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D21Ocg9kVsU))
3) Insert stabilizers into PCB (if yours are PCB mounted too)
4) Align plate on top of PCB
5) Insert switches into plate and PCB
6) Check that switches are inserted properly using keyboard testing software
7) Cap the switches with keycaps
8) Place assembled PCB into bottom case
9) Cover the top case and click into place
10) Completion!
