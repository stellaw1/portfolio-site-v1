Discailmer: In Canada, 19 is the big year when teens move on to adulthood, hence why we have 19 lessons rather than the usual 18...

## 1. You never stop growing <br>
With naivety and immaturity, some thoughts can appear too concrete in our minds. Formulas, theories, goals, or perspectives, these are fluid ideas that are always subject to change, no matter when, where, or what. 

## 2. "I don't have time for ____ right now" is a bad excuse <br>
Though it may seem like there is never enough time to check off everything on your bucketlist, it definitely is possible with help from prioritizing and perseverance. In a single day, there is a limited amount of time. Add to that, classes and necessities (Eg, eating, sleeping, and exercising), there is an even smaller amount of free time left. However, even in the most rigorous program - engineering - I have found that there is some free time in every day, that if put to good use, can add up to mean something significant. 

## 3. Ambition can be harmful, too <br>
Continuing on from the last lesson... Ambition can also harm a person when it comes in large maginitudes or long durations. 

## 4. Choose to be happy <br>
From meeting new people and having fresh conversations, I have learnt that happiness is heavily reliant on perspectives. While pessimists see happiness as spikes in a typically flat line, optimists see happiness as the flat line with occasional dips which represent some not so happy moments. 

## 5. Some friendships never die <br>
Maybe I am a little too young to use the word "never", but

## 6. I am super lucky <br>
We should always be reflective and appreciative of what we have because it is so easy to lose perspective. 

## 7. Music can change a lot <br>
Memories. Friedships. Emotions. Stress. 

## 8. Be kind <br>
I know this is one of the first lessons we learn as a kid, but, seriously, be kind to one another. More recently, with foreign religions, ideas, and lifestyles ? spreading, it seems as if everybody has an input. As important as it is too spread awareness and end the stigma on these ideas, there is also an equal amount (if not more) hate spreaidng among these debates. Like everybody should just mind their own business and let others live THEIR lives however they want to. Like they say "If you don't have somehting nice to say, then don't say it."

## 9. Express love to those that you love often<br>
Sometimes, even though we may believe it to be obvious, it is still important to express in words our appreciation of partners, friends, and family. It is always warm to hear that you are loved. 

## 10. Make a plan <br>
I am a sucker for to-do lists. Not only does it serve as a reminder for my poor memory, it also supplies a certain satisfaction in checking off the little box after having completed a task, whether big or small. 

## 11. Reflect often <br> 
I began bullet journalling at the end of last summer, however, I soon realized it wasn't as effective as I imagined it. It was taking up a lot of precious time that I should've spent studying and ended up in the back of my bookshelf. I realized that bullet journaling is something that may help me in the future, maybe after I have a routine during work or anything of the sort. For now, I will stick to my method of journalling: documenting significant event in five words or less. 

## 11. Perseverence is hard <br>
This. Especially, with working out and eating healthy. It is not easy to stay consistent every single day. You do what you can. 

## 12. Treat yourself <br>
Self care and self love is the new thing!! Treat yourself after having worked hard on a project, a course, or a workout! 

## 13. Learn to say no <br>
In the past, I used to believe that flaking on plans with friends was the worst thing you could do. Now, I truly believe that it is 100% acceptable to cancel on plans if you are not in the right mindset and need to take a mental day. 

## 14. Live a litte <br>
Sometimes, I need to stop worrying about every person and every little detail and just let loose so my mind can relaxxx. 

## 15. My family means everything to me <br>
This speaks for itself. My parents have sacrificed everything for my brother and I, and even then, all they ask for is for us to be healthy and happy. I am forever grateful of my happy little family and can only hope that I can grow up to treat them  half as well as they have me. 

## 16. Have a little faith <br>
Ask for help when needed and trust in others. 

## 17. Forgive and forget <br>
For their sake and yours. Grudges don't help anyone. Just be more careful the next time to avoid it. 

## 18. Speak your feelings <br>
If you feel like fighting, fight. If you feel like arguing, argue. Sometimes the little things are better spoken even if it leads to an argument. It is important to speak your thoughts and give both parties a chance to stand up for themselves. If everything just continues to get pushed down, you have to live unhappily, while the other is clueless about it. 

## 19. Live in the moment <br>
As someone that overthinks everything, I often find myself feeling sad in happy situations because I am fast forwarding ahead to when the moment ends. One of the biggest goals I have made for myself is to try to forget everything else and just enjoy the company while it lasts, and accepting that it will be sad when it ends but more happy moments will come.
