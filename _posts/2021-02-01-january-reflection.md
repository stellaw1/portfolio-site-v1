wow, it's been a while since my last blog post/ reflection


Honestly, I planned to continue doing monthly reflections going into 2021, since they are really good for tracking and motivating my growth. But, somewhere in between, the low of COVID and quarantine hit. I know I was not the only one struggling to keep a strong and healthy mindset towards the last few months of quarantine (for us it was around April~July). It was difficult to find motivation for anything. Every day was the same. Wake up, work from home, play games, sleep, and repeat. Life became dull. It became difficult for me to find excitement in life, and that says a lot from someone who typically has the energy levels of a 5 year old.

At some point, I decided that something needed to change. On a whim, I used the excuse of helping my brother move out to fly to Toronto to visit him. Logically, this trip would not have helped anything. I was risking catching COVID to travel to another city that was in lockdown. But in hindsight, the change of pace was all I needed. I was still working from home and playing games (not seeing people or handing out in public spaces), but I got to spend some quality time with my brother who forced me to take a 30 minute walk with him everyday. Slowly, colour came back into my life. The COVID cases started winding down. The US started rolling out vaccinations. The end seemed near.

At this point, it was around May 2021 meaning my internship had ended and summer school started. The city started phasing out of complete quarantine, so I spent as much time as I could with my best friend and another friend even came to visit on my birthday. These small hang outs were so precious to me and genuinely gave me excitement looking forward to the rest of summer.

Fast forward to June, it was time for me to fly back to BC. June was spent moving into my new place, keeping up with 3 summer courses and hanging out with old and new friends. By July, most of us were fully vaccinated meaning roadtrips and camping trips. These post covid trips made my heart so full despite being simple activities. They were with great people and we all treasured the time preciously after being quarantined for so long. The two trips I went on to Whistler and Nanaimo were both vlogged and will be archived in the folder "treasured memories from the summer after covid".

Now, we are nearing the end of "the summer after covid". There are two weeks left and I am beyond excited to start school. Call me a nerd, but I've always enjoyed school because it usually meant growth. And especially after a year of working and a summer of fun, I am very excietd to be learning new things again.


Excited about life, <br>
