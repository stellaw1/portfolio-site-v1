My hometown, Taiwan, documented on film.  

## Big Family
One of my absolute favourite things about travelling to Taiwan is being able to see my family. As a first generation immigrant, there are many sacrifices that my family and I have had to make, one of the hardest ones is being separated from our family. Because of this, the time we get to spend together becomes more valuable. 

## New year, new me ?
Normally, I am a pretty introverted and self-conscious person. I once read in a book that the reason people have an intrinsic fear of public speaking is because they are essentially risking their reputation and credibility. This is me with every situation, though. I dislike being put on the spot, out of fear of messing up. However, this year, I have been loving doing things that terrify me. There is a thrill in doing things that you have never done before, given you are essentially forcing yourself to grow as a person. So, as a resolution for the new year, I am going to continue encouraging myself to participate in events that allow me to "threaten my reputation" in order to grow and learn exponentially. 

## The Vlogs
Filming everything I did in Taiwan originally started as a joke between me and my friends, but I soon realized that there are too many fascinating and quirky things in Taiwan that need to be remembered forever. So, with a "why not" attitude, I decided to yet again put my reputation on the line. With my iPhone and some quick edits in iMovie, I present to you a series: My hometown, Taiwan, documented.
