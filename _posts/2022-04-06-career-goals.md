title: Narrowing down career paths
tags: blog

I think I've finally discovered the career path I want to pursue. 

Such a special moment because I am a super indecisive person who never really knows what I want most of the time. This is the hardest part for me because after I realize and decide what it is that I want (in any aspect of life) I work my ass off to make sure I get it. There is a fallacy in this that I hate and am working on changing. I often will turn away from specific goals if I don't think they are feasible out of fear of rejection. 

I digress. I recently started working on Solana and I love everything about it
- the community - the maintainers are super helpful responsive and encouraging
- the passion - there is something so inspiring about hearing someone talk about their work with genuine interest and passion 
- the code - I like TypeScript. I'm decent at it, and I find the codebase easy to understand (Rust)
- the newness - this is new technology and I want to be amongst the experts at it
- the pace - everything moves very quickly in web 3.0. Libraries, other repos, etc can experience version bumps within days
- the concept - web 3.0 has so much potential and beats web 2.0 in so many ways
- the skills that are translatable to any software development work aka a good backup plan for my anxious self
- the need for self learning, self motivation, and the curiosity to learn
- the freedom of remote work and flexible hours
- the money - enough said
