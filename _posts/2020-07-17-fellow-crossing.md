An animal crossing inspired game I built as a submission to the MLH Fellowship Halfway Hackathon. 


# Fellow Crossing

### Summary
Kanava, Ruby, Nabanita, and I formed a team to tackle the gap between fellows throughout this remote internship. We wanted to simulate the small talk and the candid breaks in an in person office space that promotes socialization between coworkers. 

This project was built in submission to the Halfway Hackathon for the MLH Fellowship, and was awarded "Best Community Building Project"

### What it does
Fellow Crossing is a video game that encourages socialization between coworkers. It includes a spacious map with a server-wide chatbox feature, a coffee room with voice calling features, a music room with synchronized background music, and a personal office space with customizable furniture. These features were developed with the goal of encouraging small talk and mingling amongst fellows during their break times.

### How it was built 
The game was fundamentally built using the Godot game engine and Gd scripts. The server-side SQL database and game host is through AWS, while the client-side game is published on itch io. Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator were used to create graphics for the game, and Python scripts were written for the voice chat and music room features.
