## Day 1 <br>

6AM- hella passed out on the bus, appreciation for not having to drive
Always nice seeing an old friend
A couple ideas going in
Picked one and went with it (knowing our limits and choosing the idea with most potential to affect change)
Kind of lost at beginning, not sure what to do/ how to help
Sometimes harder to collaborate then work on own but time limit and wider skills
Ended up working on front end
want to learn more front end skills and do more events like these to meet experienced and knowledgeable people
Jayson is cool- I like his app
Seattle is really the place to be: I would love to do an internship here
Note: create an app to carry your interviews

## Key takeaways: <br>
⁃ don’t doubt, just do. You could’ve been $100 richer today

⁃ Don’t give up! Get over the learning curve
⁃ AI is cool and has so much potential
⁃ I need a dog
⁃ Learn to ask questions and utilize available resources

## Day 2: <br>
⁃ exhausted
⁃ Really inspiring to see the capability and ideas that other team came up with
⁃ AI and machine learning is super powerful and is truly where the potential is
⁃ It is important to keep up with new technologies and always be networking
⁃ Ie, talk to dad about his work !
⁃ Never give up and keep the passion on fire

⁃ Better luck next time (defs target specific challenges) 💪🏼

## To-Do: <br>
