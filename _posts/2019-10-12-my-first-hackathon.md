Here is a log of what happened at my first ever hackathon and some reflections. 

## Day 1 - October 12th, 2019 <br>
The expereience began with the dreaded 6AM wakeup call. After approximately 3 hours of passing out on the bus, we arrived at the University of Washington. At this point I was super excited because I had a couple of interesting ideas I wanted to develop, but also I was seeing an old friend that I haven't seen in a while. 

Picked one and went with it (knowing our limits and choosing the idea with most potential to affect change)
Kind of lost at beginning, not sure what to do/ how to help
Sometimes harder to collaborate then work on own but time limit and wider skills
Ended up working on front end
want to learn more front end skills and do more events like these to meet experienced and knowledgeable people
Jayson is cool- I like his app
Seattle is really the place to be: I would love to do an internship here
Note: create an app to carry your interviews

## Key takeaways: <br>
- don‚Äôt doubt, just do. You could‚Äôve been $100 richer today
- If you have an idea you can do it!
- Don‚Äôt give up! Get over the learning curve
- AI is cool and has so much potential
- I need a dog
- Learn to ask questions and utilize available resources
- Growth mindset: failure is good. You are challenging yourself by even being in this field. Do your best!!

## Day 2: <br>
- exhausted
- Really inspiring to see the capability and ideas that other team came up with
- AI and machine learning is super powerful and is truly where the potential is
- It is important to keep up with new technologies and always be networking
- Ie, talk to dad about his work !
- Never give up and keep the passion on fire
- Community track is always a good place to start if running out of fresh ideas. Think of yourself/ disadvantages against yourself or others around you/ close to you
- Better luck next time (defs target specific challenges) üí™üèº

## To-Do: <br>
- Setup new blog
- Stella‚Äôs journey to becoming a tech savvy
- Goals (you know those goals that you always say oh I‚Äôm gonna do this but never get around to doing bc or lame excuses or you just forget about them well this post is to document some of my current goals and to in part hold me to my words in ink)
