During Spring 2022, through the MLH Fellowship, I made some meaningful contributions to Solana's open-source projects and learnt an immense amount about Solana and blockchain in general. 

# Solana Web3
The @solana/web3.js repository is a library containing the necessary tools to interact with the Solana blockchain. The tools included in this repository include reading from the Solana blockchain, writing transactions, and executing transactions. For this spring, I am focused on improving the overall developer experience of using @solana/web3.js, making the tools easier, extending the usability, and improving the consumption by the developer community.
