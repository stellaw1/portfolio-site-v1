Built a turing complete simple Reduced Instruction Set Computer machine with branching and memory functions on the FPGA component of a De1-SoC board using Verilog. 

## Purpose
Built in the lab of a Microcomputers course at UBC. 

## Functions
- Finite State Machine (FSM) controller
- Program Counter (PC)
- Stack
- Branching
- Condition 
- Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) 
- Memory
- Register files
- Shifter Unit
- Status flags

## Concepts practiced
- Pipelining
- Verilog
- Writing testbenches
- Code review

## Reflection
Gained a stronger understanding in the fundamental hardware of a computer.
