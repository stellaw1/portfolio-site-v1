Randomly started missing this old game. 

# PyGames Version

### Prototype

### Summary
I built a simplified, beta version of the infamous rage-inducing game, flappy bird, with [Arnold](https://arnoldying.github.io). We built it using PyGames and started with very minimal graphics and rough functions. This version is still undergoing upgrades and fine-tuning. 



# JavaScript Version

### Prototype
View game here: [https://github.com/stellaw1/FlappyBird/index.html](https://github.com/stellaw1/FlappyBird/index.html)

### Summary 
I then branched off of the original version and started developing a separate version of flappy bird using JavaScript instead of Python. The reason I did this was because I wanted to create a version of the game to act as the landing page for my portfolio website, and multiple sources indicated that hosting Python backend on GitHub pages was tricky (plus I need more practice with JavaScript).
