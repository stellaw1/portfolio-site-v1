I spent my summer 2020 as a remote fellow for the [MLH Fellowship program](https://fellowship.mlh.io/students), and wanted to document the abundance of skills I learnt.

## Current project: Circuit Python
The epotime of this fellowship is to collaborate to contribute to open source projects, such as Circuit Python. As I indicated interest in hardware development, I was assigned to Circuit Python. Our first project is to improve features on an app named 'glider' that acts as a Python code editor for mobile devices. The first week was dedicated to setting up my app development environment (Android studio, react native, node JS, etc), while the second week was spent waiting for hardware to arrive...

  <p>

  <h6> Date: June 17th, 2020 </h6>
  <h5> Notes </h5>
  <ul>
    <li>Docker is a tool that makes it easier to code software by using containers - similar to VM</li>
    <li>'sudo' in Linux is "super user do"</li>
    <li>'cp' is copy</li>
    <li>container is an instance of an image</li>
    <li>'docker run' on an image to bring up a contianer</li>
    <li>Use Cases (to get to know Docker and its industry applications): https://www.docker.com/use-cases
Getting started with Docker (pretty comprehensive guide on a lot of Docker stuff): https://docker-curriculum.com/
Creating Docker Images (both from an exisitng container and from scratch): https://www.mirantis.com/blog/how-do-i-create-a-new-docker-image-for-my-application/</li>

## Highlights
<details>
  <summary><h5>Orientation Hackathon</h5></summary>
  <p>

  <h6> Date: June 1st~5th, 2020</h6>
  For the first week of the fellowship, I worked on an exciting project revolving the BLM movement with Amir and Parthiv. I loved the end product we produced and enjoyed my time working with my fellow podmates

  <summary><h5>Random</h5></summary>
  <p>

  <h6> Date: June 1st, 2020</h6>
  Meeting people for the first time ever on Zoom was a strange experience, and I can't imagine what any of my podmates would be like if we ever met in person. Many nuances and traits are lost through virtual videocalling as opposed to an in person meeting (Eg, small habits, height, voice, etc)<br>
  
  <h6> Date: June 8th, 2020 </h6>
  MLH really likes to ask the question, "What is your favourite project that you've worked on?" and my answer always comes back to this website - not becuase it is technically impressive or graphically beautiful, but because of the ability for me to come back here continually to document how I've been growing/ highlights/ etc<br>
  
  <h6> Date: June 10th, 2020 </h6>
  My mentor, Cory, is the coolest! He has pet chickens and considers chocolate fruit (& therefore Nutella jam)<br>
