I spent my summer 2020 as a remote fellow for the [MLH Fellowship program](https://fellowship.mlh.io/students), and wanted to document the abundance of skills I learnt.

## Current project: Circuit Python
The epotime of this fellowship is to collaborate to contribute to open source projects, such as Circuit Python. As I indicated interest in hardware development, I was assigned to Circuit Python. Our first project is to improve features on an app named 'glider' that acts as a Python code editor for mobile devices. The first week was dedicated to setting up my app development environment (Android studio, react native, node JS, etc), while the second week was spent waiting for hardware to arrive...


## Journal
*June 5th* - Submitted hackathon project, and was voted best project in my pod<br>
*June 9th* - Finally placed the order for a monitor and keyboard - next step, save up for new PC !<br>
*June 10th* - Diving deep into the code base for CircuitPython, and struggling to write/ test code without proper hardware<br>
*June 22nd* - Got my glider app running on an android device after weeks of waiting for hardware and debugging!<br>
*July 2nd* - Start research & development into adding colour wheel feature to glider<br>


## Skills
*Python* - getting more familiar with syntax<br>
*GitHub* - Pull Requests, Issues, Branching, Merging<br>
*MongoDB* - local database, PyMongo, Flask frontend<br>
*React Native* - development/ deployment, new libraries


## Workshops

  <summary><b>Cory's show and tell, Python unit testing</b></summary>
  <div>

  <h6> Date: June 10th, 2020 </h6>
  <h5> Notes </h5>
  <ul>
    <li>unit test vs integration test</li>
    <li>asswertEqual same as Java</li>
    <li>virtual environment for python</li>
    <li>monkey patching using 'mock' library</li>
    <li>dependency inheritance</li>
    <li>principle of competition over inheritance</li>
    <li>eg, application for using mock = mock database for local testing</li>
  </ul>
  <h5> To Do </h5>
  <ul>
    <li>[unit test vs integration test](https://programwithus.com/learn-to-code/Pip-and-virtualenv-on-Windows/)</li>

  <summary><b>Amir's show and tell, Docker</b></summary>
  <div>

  <h6> Date: June 17th, 2020 </h6>
  <h5> Notes </h5>
  <ul>
    <li>Docker is a tool that makes it easier to code software by using containers - similar to VM</li>
    <li>'sudo' in Linux is "super user do"</li>
    <li>'cp' is copy</li>
    <li>container is an instance of an image</li>
    <li>'docker run' on an image to bring up a contianer</li>
    <li>Use Cases (to get to know Docker and its industry applications): https://www.docker.com/use-cases
Getting started with Docker (pretty comprehensive guide on a lot of Docker stuff): https://docker-curriculum.com/
Creating Docker Images (both from an exisitng container and from scratch): https://www.mirantis.com/blog/how-do-i-create-a-new-docker-image-for-my-application/</li>

  <summary><b>Mini Hackathon - Conway's game of life</b></summary>
  <div>

  <h6> Date: June 24th, 2020 </h6>
  <h5> Notes </h5>
  <ul>
    <li>This was an interesting show and tell of the week. My podmates and I got to collaborate and develop a solution for [Conway's game of life](http://pi.math.cornell.edu/~lipa/mec/lesson6.html) in Python. </li>
    <li>The goal of this hackathon was let us become more familiar with git commands - such as branching, issues, pr, etc - since the majority of our pod spent the majority of the first two weeks awaiting hardware.  </li>
    <li>Python is not my main coding language (I have made 2? projects in python), so I was proud to have written a solution that even runs within an hour... after stealing some code from podmates of course (we were allowed to!)</li>
  </ul>

  <h6> Date: July 1st, 2020 </h6>
  <h5> Notes </h5>
  <ul>
    <li>focuses on smaller, more novel devices</li>
    <li>consume less resources</li>
  </ul>

## Highlights
<details>
  <summary><b>Orientation Hackathon</b></summary>
  <div>

  <h6> Date: June 1st~5th, 2020</h6>
  For the first week of the fellowship, I worked on an exciting project revolving the BLM movement with Amir and Parthiv. I loved the end product we produced and enjoyed my time working with my fellow podmates

  <summary><b>Random</b></summary>
  <div>

  <h6> Date: June 1st, 2020</h6>
  Meeting people for the first time ever on Zoom was a strange experience, and I can't imagine what any of my podmates would be like if we ever met in person. Many nuances and traits are lost through virtual videocalling as opposed to an in person meeting (Eg, small habits, height, voice, etc)<br>
  
  <h6> Date: June 8th, 2020 </h6>
  MLH really likes to ask the question, "What is your favourite project that you've worked on?" and my answer always comes back to this website - not becuase it is technically impressive or graphically beautiful, but because of the ability for me to come back here continually to document how I've been growing/ highlights/ etc<br>
  
  <h6> Date: June 10th, 2020 </h6>
  My mentor, Cory, is the coolest! He has pet chickens and considers chocolate fruit (& therefore Nutella jam)<br>

  <h6> Date: June 25th, 2020 </h6>
  Random, interesting, trivial bug in python: where `f = lambda: 1` outputs `1` whereas `fs = {;ambda: x for x in range(10)}` outputs all `9`s. Solved this by `fn = {lambda y=x: y for x in range(10)` <br>
