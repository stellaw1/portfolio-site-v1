I spent my summer 2020 as a remote fellow for the [MLH Fellowship program](https://fellowship.mlh.io/students), and wanted to document the abundance of skills I learnt. 



## Journal
*June 5th* - Submitted hackathon project, and was voted best project in my pod
*June 10th* - Diving deep into the code base for CircuitPython, and struggling to write/ test code without proper hardware


## Skills
*Python* - 
*GitHub* - Pull Requests, Issues, Branching, Merging
*MongoDB* - local database, PyMongo, Flask frontend


## Workshops
<details>
  <summary>Cory's show and tell, Python unit testing</summary>

  #### Date: June 10th, 2020

  ## Notes
  - unit test vs integration test
  - asswertEqual same as Java
  - virtual environment for python
  - monkey patching using 'mock' library
  - dependency inheritance
  - principle of competition over inheritance
  - eg, application for using mock = mock database for local testing

  Meeting people for the first time ever on Zoom was a strange experience, and I can't imagine what any of my podmates would be like if we ever met in person. Many nuances and traits are lost through virtual videocalling as opposed to an in person meeting (Eg, small habits, height, voice, etc)

  MLH really likes to ask the question, "What is your favourite project that you've worked on?" and my answer always comes back to this website - not becuase it is technically impressive or graphically beautiful, but because of the ability for me to come back here continually to document how I've been growing/ highlights/ etc

  My mentor, Cory, is the coolest! He has pet chickens and considers chocolate fruit (& therefore Nutella jam)
