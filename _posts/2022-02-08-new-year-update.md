On paper not a lot has happened or changed since my last blog post. My first semester of third year went pretty smoothly - passed all my courses, made some new friends, worked on some extracurricular project. There were definitely ups and downs in the semester. At times, I would struggle with assignments for my operating systems course until demon hours. Other times, when I would catch a break, my friends and I got to make some core memories (star gazing, playing ultimate, trying out new food places, etc)

And then christmas rolled around. It was the best time despite being so far away from my parents. I was surrounded by many loved ones and am super lucky to have them in my life. There was not a single day during winter break that was not packed with plans. Skiing, gingerbread house competitions, cooking, movies, we did it all. It was such a well spent winter break that it was super difficult to go back to school again. 

By the time January came around, Omicron was everywhere. School was online and people stopped going out. Unfortunately, I caught it and was pretty sick for a week. Fortunately though, it wasn't too serious. I slept through an entire week and drank enough hot water to fill a hot tub. My friends also kept me company on discord while my brother made sure I didn't starve while isolating. I'm super fortunate to have recovered quickly with much support from close ones. 

Now, school is back in person, I'm on a team that is contributing to Solana, and spend the weekends hanging out with old and new friends. Things are in full speed and I love and hate it at the same time. I love this time in my life, in my 20s where I get to do basically anything and everything I put my heart to, but it is also so easy to burn myself out. I think I have successfully reached a point where I can pretty accurately grasp the balance between work and life to prevent any burnouts. I am so so happy with my life right now. The plans I have lined up adn the things I am working on now are exactly where I want to be. My friends are the greatest, we always have the best time together and I get to see my parents very soon (after the school year ends and before my summer job begins). I get to meet so many new friends - at school and at work. Even the smallest things like food, music, and good weather are treating me well. Life is good! 

The biggest goal I set for myself this semester is to be hyper aware of my stress and anxiety levels. It is super easy for me to spiral and overthink leading to bad anxiety where I shut myself off from close ones and simmer in my feels. I'm hoping to be more conscious of this and let the little things go so they don't go to my head. This will be easier said than done but it will be a huge milestone. 

I also want to continue my goal of meeting new people and trying new experiences. In this world, it is so easy to forget what's important. It is so easy to get wrapped up in first world issues that seem like the end of the world when in reality, looking at the bigger picture they should not even be considered a problem. There are countless issues (global warming, poverty, child labour, and many more) that desperately need to be solved, but are being brushed away or ignored by willfully ignorant people like myself. I'm not saying this to toot my own horn. I am very much a part of the problem and am contributing to it constantly without even knowing. It is often humbling to be reminded of this realization. At the very least, as a first step I think we all need to address the issue and stop bushing it under the rug. I was talking to a friend about what a fulfilling life would be beecause throughout the years we have both lost certain expecations of the world - disappointed by too many people or happennings. We decided a fulfilling life would be one where we can help make anyone's life better. In the end, if we achieve nothing with our lives or are forever unhappy, if we at least help make one person's life better or help alleviate one issue in the world, we would call that a fulfilling life. I'm trying to keep this thought in the forefront of my mind, as I do my best to not make current issues worse. 




Excited about life, <br>
