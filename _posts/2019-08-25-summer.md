title: 19 lessons I've learnt at 19

Discailmer: In Canada, 19 is the big year when teens move on to adulthood, hence why we have 19 lessons rather than the usual 18...

##1. You never stop growing <br>
With naivety and immaturity, some thoughts can appear too concrete in our minds. Formulas, theories, goals, or perspectives

##2. "I don't have time for ____ right now" is a bad excuse <br>
Though it may seem like there is never enough time to check off everything on your bucketlist, it definitely is possible with help from prioritizing and perseverance. In a single day, there is a limited amount of time. Add to that, classes and necessities (Eg, eating, sleeping, and exercising), there is an even smaller amount of free time left. However, even in the most rigorous program - engineering - I have found that there is some free time in every day, that if put to good use, can add up to mean something significant. 

##3. Ambition can be harmful, too <br>
Continuing on from the last lesson... Ambition can also harm a person when it comes in large maginitudes or long durations. 

##4. Choose to be happy <br>
From meeting new people and having fresh conversations, I have learnt that happiness is heavily reliant on perspectives. While pessimists see happiness as spikes in a typically flat line, optimists see happiness as the flat line with occasional dips which represent some not so happy moments. 

##5. Some friendships never die <br>
Maybe I am a little too young to use the word "never", but

##6. I am super lucky <br>
Remeber to appreciate what you have 

##7. Music can change a lot <br>
Memories. Friedships. Emotions. Stress. 

##8. Be kind <br>
I know this is one of the first lessons we learn as a kid, but, seriously, be kind to one another. More recently, with foreign religions, ideas, and lifestyles ? spreading, it seems as if everybody has an input. As important as it is too spread awareness and end the stigma on these ideas, there is also an equal amount (if not more) hate spreaidng among these debates. Like everybody should just mind their own business and let others live THEIR lives however they want to. Like they say "If you don't have somehting nice to say, then don't say it."
