I want to build an iOS app using Swift

## Inspiration
Honestly, there have been too many times in my daily life where I thought to myself, "I wish there was an app for _____", so why not use my own life as an inspiration for a project. 

## Purpose
Undecided yet, but some ideas that I have come across so far are below...

Ideas: 
- Notification hub that parses your course websites and sends the user notification whenever an assignment, lab, or exam is coming up
- A question a day app that sends your answers to a database and allows deep reflection of your mood, mentality, and growth throughout the year at the end of the year. 
- Pet food tracker that uses a pet diet API to automatically remind the pet owner what food and what time to feed their pets. 

## Plans
