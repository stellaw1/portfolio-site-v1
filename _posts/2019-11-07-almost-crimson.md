Happy November 7th! Today is a good day because Starbucks started making their annal holiday drinks, which pretty much marks the beginning of the holiday season!

## Holiday Spirit <br>
The reason why Christmas is my favourite time of the year is mainly because it's the one time in the year that I get to see my family. The dispersement of my little family of four (Mom, Dad, Brother, and I) is a complicated story...

TLDR: Mom and Dad both live and work in Taiwan. Brother goes to school in Toronto, and I go to school in Vancouver. Every year we choose a different place to spend Christmas: last year it was Vancouver, this year it will be Taiwan, and maybe next year it will be Toronto!

I realize that we are extremely lucky to be a family that gets along well and to have the opportunity to travel to each other. 

## Spread Cheer <br>
Family is one of the most wholesome parts of Christmas, but also it is a time that many people choose to give back. As it is close to the end of the year, many people - including myself - spend time to reflect and be grateful for the things we have, whether big or small. It is also important to realize that no matter how extravagant or conservative you may think your life is, there is almost always someone that has less than you. Perspective is everything. Realizing that instead of chasing things that we want in our lives, maybe it is more important to give to others that may need it more. 

Below is a list of things I want to accomplish this Christmas season

## My Christmas 2019 checklist <br>
1. Decorate my apartment 
   Not anything super significant, but having a small tree and a couple green and red decorations to wake up to everyday brightens my day. 
2. An act of kindness
   Whether it's buying a stranger a cup of coffee or donating to a homeless shelter, I want to do everything I can to give back to those in need. (UPDATE: I'm going to buy a cup of coffee for my bus driver every morning starting in December)
3. Spoil my friends and family
   These are the most important people in my life that keep my sane on a daily basis and they deserve to be treated like 
4. Be the happiest I can be :)
   This one isn't super difficult because I realize how fortunate I am to be who I am and live the life that I do. Plus, I become a brand new person during this time of the year and am pretty much hyper-energetic everyday.
