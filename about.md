![me](https://github.com/stellaw1/stellaw1.github.io/blob/master/images/me.jpg?raw=true){: .center-image}

My name is Stella Wang, and I am a third year computer engineering student at the University of British Columbia. At my first hackathon, (DubHacks at the University of Washington), the many creative and innovative projects inspired me to tackle personal projects of my own. The first one is to build a personal web page portfolio, which also helps to track my goals and make them more actionable. Here I will attempt to keep my projects, resume, and blog updated. 


## What am I up to right now?
###### Updated: June 25th
For the summer of 2020, I am and will be contributing to open source projects on GitHub as an [MLH Fellow](https://fellowship.mlh.io/students). I am working with a team of 10 fellows, including myself, plus one mentor - Cory. Furthermore, I have been assigned to contribute to [Circuit Python](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython) by closing issues, editing documentation, and improving features. Two of my podmates and I are currently working on developing a mobile app, named [glider](https://github.com/adafruit/glider), which acts as a mobile code editor when working with Circuit Python on Adafruit hardware.
