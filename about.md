Some information about you!

### More Information

My name is Stella Wang, and I am a computer engineering student at the University of British Columbia. Recently, at the DubHacks hackathon at the University of Washington, I was inspired to attempt various personal projects, including building a web page portfolio. Here I will attempt to keep my projects, resume, and blog updated.
